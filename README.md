autoCpp
=======
By David Vaughan

Take a simple C++ header file and generate a .cpp file template from the
specifications.
Intended for use with my school projects and homework, but should work for many
simple header files.

Slight tweaks and adjustments to the output may be necessary.

Compile:
Type "make" in the source directory

Run:
Move "autoCpp" to where your header file is and type "./autoCpp"
