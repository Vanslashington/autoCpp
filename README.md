autoCpp
=======
By David Vaughan

**Not yet functional**

Take a simple C++ header file and generate a .cpp file template from the
specifications.
Intended for use with my school projects and homework, but should work for any
simple header file.

Compile:
Type "make" in the source directory

Run:
Move "autoCpp" where your header file is and type "./autoCpp"
