autoCpp
=======
By David Vaughan

Take a simple C++ header file and generate a .cpp file template from the
specifications.
Intended for use with my school projects and homework, but should work for many
simple header files.

The program is able to take a .h file containing one templated class with 
functions, and produce a mostly-compileable .cpp file from it.

Slight tweaks and adjustments to the output may be necessary.

Compile:
Type "make" in the source directory

Run:
Move "autoCpp" to where your header file is and type "./autoCpp"
